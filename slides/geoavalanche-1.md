# Background

* Every avalanche has a place, shape and path which can be spatially described
* Avalanche information are complex and **structured data**
    * *avalanche danger*, *incidents*, *weather observations*, *snowpack*, *bulletins*
* Worldwide **Avalanche Warning Services** are source of truth *but often are unstructured organizations* (nationally and regionally) where geospatial ICT is totally/partly missing
* **Bulletins** and **avalanche danger** are their forecast products at **regional scale resolution** while the public runs activities at microscale (*slope*, *aspect*, *elevation*, *temperature*, *recent wind activities*, *snowpack*)
