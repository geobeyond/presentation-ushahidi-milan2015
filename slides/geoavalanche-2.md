# Rationale

- **Tourists**
    - attempt in the wilderness with a number as much as increased in the latest years
    - are not totally aware of the risk
    - claim innovative early warning alert systems
- **Mountain professionals**
    - plan their activities more often via mobile devices
    - make their business on the safety of outdoor activities
    - could be actively involved to report snowslide-prone areas as the situation evolves (human sensors)
