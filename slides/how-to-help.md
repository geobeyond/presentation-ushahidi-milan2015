# How to help

__*Italian community is actively involved with a lot of deployments*__:

* Support the localization of software (**_V3 is at 5%_**) - you don't need to be a coder, [__*transifex*__](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/ushahidi-v3/) is your friend
* Support the translation of technical documentation, here again use the online service [__*gitbook*__](https://www.gitbook.com/book/geobeyond/ushahidi-user-manual/dashboard)
* If you need custom developments or plugins then ask the experts or raise funds for new [__*features*__](https://phabricator.ushahidi.com/project/view/1/), otherwise if you are a developer make your hacks and then spread the word so community can benefit from it
