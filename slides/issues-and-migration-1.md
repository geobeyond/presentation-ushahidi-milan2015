# Issues and migration

__*Challenges*__:

* We are waiting for a stable version of [Ushahidi V3](http://v3.ushahidi.com) to perform migration
    * Manage with the mobile clients which are massively using custom forms with old API system
    * Alignment of the GeoAvalanche custom theme to the V3 look & feel
* Possibly deploy into a [dockerized](https://www.docker.com) __Ushahidi__
