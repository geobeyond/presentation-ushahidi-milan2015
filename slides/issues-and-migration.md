# Issues and migration

__*Open issues*__:

* Capability to define roles certain with assigned **geographical areas** where they are allowed to verify and approve reports, aka known as **[georole](http://www.ushahidi.com/2012/11/23/geoavalanche-case-study-input-for-ushahidi-3-0/) functionality** (i.e. nation-wide, region-wide)
    * Tackled from the [Grant MacEwan team](http://www.kyleyasinski.ca/index.php/portfolio/10-auto-generate-from-title/16-2013-ushahidi-geo-role) - Still evaluating this integration with [2.7.4](https://github.com/hnatiwm4/Ushahidi-GeoRole-Project)
* Handling with **[multisite](http://www.ushahidi.com/2012/11/23/geoavalanche-case-study-input-for-ushahidi-3-0/)** Ushahidi deployment for visualizing restricted sets of reports only from certain subdomains (i.e. even here nation-wide, region-wide scenarios)
    * __*Why not different Ushahidi installations*__? It could ever possible but there would be limited from the lack of a unique central users database
